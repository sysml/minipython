 * hexdump - print a text hexdump for a binary blob of data
 * @buf: data blob to dump
 * @len: number of bytes in the @buf
 * @prefix_str: null-terminated string that is prefixed to each line
 * @addr_type: controls whether the offset address, full address, or none
 *  is printed in front of each line (%HDAT_RELATIVE, %HDAT_ABSOLUTE,
 *  %HDAT_NONE)
 * @addr_offset: An offset that is added to each printed address if %addr_tpe is
 *  set to %HDAT_RELATIVE
 * @rowlen: number of buffer bytes to print per line
 * @groupsize: number of bytes to print as group together
 * @show_ascii_comlumn: include ASCII after the hex output
 *
 * Example output using %HDAT_RELATIVE and 4-byte mode:
 * 0009ab42: 40 41 42 43  44 45 46 47 @ABCD EFGH
 * Example output using %HDAT_ABSOLUTE and 2-byte mode:
 * ffffffff88089af0: 73 72  71 70  77 76  75 74 pq rs tu vw
